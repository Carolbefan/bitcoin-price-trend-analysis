# Bitcoin Price Trend Analysis (2022‚Äì2025)

This is a personal FinTech-focused project analyzing Bitcoin price trends using real market data and Python-based data science tools.

## üîç Project Background & Motivation

This project initially began as a trend analysis and short-term forecasting of Bitcoin (BTC) prices using Python, Pandas, and yFinance. Through this process, I deepened my understanding of how blockchain assets behave as financial time series ‚Äî exhibiting high volatility, momentum patterns, and often being influenced by macroeconomic factors and speculative sentiment.

While BTC is often considered a digital store of value, its underlying technology ‚Äî blockchain ‚Äî enables a wide range of decentralized applications beyond currency. This naturally leads to Web3.0, where user identity, ownership, and transactions are all managed on-chain.

One major application in the Web3 space is NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). The NFT model ‚Äî verifiable digital ownership ‚Äî shares conceptual similarity with the **blind box economy**, where consumers open randomized products without knowing the exact contents. This led me to investigate the potential of integrating NFT logic with **Pop Mart**, a well-known IP-based collectible toy brand.

By analyzing the similarities between Pop Mart‚Äôs physical product model and NFT-based digital assets, I propose that integrating NFTs and blockchain technology could allow Pop Mart to:
- Offer digital blind boxes that mimic physical surprises
- Extend IP licensing into the metaverse
- Enable digital-physical redemption models
- Tap into a younger, crypto-savvy collector base

This project explores both the data science of crypto asset trends (BTC) and the business model potential of combining consumer IP with NFT infrastructure ‚Äî presenting a FinTech + Web3 vision that reflects the next wave of personalized, decentralized finance.
